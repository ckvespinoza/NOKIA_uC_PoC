# NOKIA_uC_PoC

This repository is to provide visibility to the code I am working on for the microcontroller (MCU/uC) based power manager project.

June 27th: I have started creating tasks to be handled with the FreeRTOS library covering power sequencing, reverse power sequencing, 
and monitoring of signals like EDSM enable, hard reset request and soft reset request.
